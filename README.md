### Simple Network Sniffer - experimental

This project is a simple network sniffer implemented in Golang. It captures packets from a specified network interface and streams them to a Kafka topic. The packets can then be consumed and processed in real-time.
Prerequisites

    Golang
    gopacket library
    sarama library for Kafka
    A running Kafka cluster

### Note

Please be aware that capturing and processing network packets can be a sensitive operation and should be done with caution. Make sure to have the appropriate permissions and understand the implications of capturing and processing network traffic before running this application.
